    <h1>Steps to Obtain a Business License in South Carolina</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Choose a Business Name</h2>
            <p>Use the <a href="https://businessfilings.sc.gov/BusinessFiling/Entity/Search" target="_blank">Business
                    Name Search tool</a> on
                the SC Secretary of State website to check the availability of your desired business name. Ensure it
                complies with South Carolina naming requirements.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Determine Your Business Structure</h2>
            <p>Decide on the type of business entity you want to establish (e.g., sole proprietorship, corporation, LLC,
                partnership, etc.).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Register Your Business Entity</h2>
            <p>File the necessary paperwork with the SC Secretary of State. You can use the <a

        <li>
            <h2>Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN)</h2>
            <p>If your business requires an EIN (most businesses do), apply for one through the <a

                an EIN if you have employees, operate as a corporation or partnership, or have a Keogh plan.</p>

                    Carolina</a>. These requirements can vary by city or county.</p>
        </li>

            <h2>Apply for a Business License</h2>
            <p>Contact the appropriate local government office to obtain the necessary business license application
                forms. This could be your city or county government office, depending on where your business is located.

                activities.</p>
        </li>

            <h2>Pay the License Fee</h2>
            <p>Fee details are available on the <a href="https://dor.sc.gov/tax" target="_blank">South Carolina
                    Department of Revenue</a> site.</p>
        </li>

            <p>Submit your completed application and payment to the local government office responsible for issuing
