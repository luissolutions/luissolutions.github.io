        traditional brokerage accounts. They allow for automation, reinvestment, and fractional share investing.</p>

    <h2>Dividend & Passive Income Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Dividend Investment Portfolio</h3>
    <p>With a $1.2M starting point, a strategy of 5% growth and 5% dividend payouts annually could yield:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Year 1 Monthly Income:</strong> $5,000</li>
        <li><strong>Year 5 Monthly Income:</strong> $6,381</li>
        <li><strong>Annual Dividend Income:</strong> $76,000</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This “infinite money” strategy can provide scalable passive income over time.</p>

    <h2>Company Profiles</h2>

        semiconductors.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started with M1</h2>
    <p>M1 lets you build a “pie” of stocks or ETFs with custom percentages. Once funded, M1 automatically invests and
        reinvests based on your selections. Bank accounts can be linked for recurring or manual deposits.</p>

    <h2>Roth IRA Strategy Using M1</h2>
    <p>Roth IRAs grow tax-free. With annual contributions of $7,000 (or more if over 50), investors can build
        substantial retirement wealth. Dividends reinvested don’t count toward the contribution cap.</p>

    <h2>Monthly Contributions Example</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Year 1: $6,300</li>
        <li>Year 3: $19,860</li>
        <li>Year 5: $34,811</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With compounding growth, a $500/month contribution could reach $735,000 in 30 years.</p>

    <h2>Portfolio Management & Rebalancing</h2>
    <p>M1’s dashboard enables you to rebalance, monitor gains, and adjust allocations as your strategy evolves.
        Dividends are auto-reinvested, and rebalancing helps you stay aligned with your goals.</p>

    <h2>Investment Tools & Calculators</h2>
    <p>Use the investment calculator to project future value based on your monthly contributions, interest rate, and
        timeline. This helps visualize long-term retirement goals.</p>

    <h2>Legal & Risk Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>All investments carry risk. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Consider speaking with a licensed
        financial advisor before making investment decisions.</p>
