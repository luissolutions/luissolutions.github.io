            <h2>Inventory Management</h2>
            <p>This SOP outlines the procedures for managing inventory at The Emporium. The goal is to ensure accurate
                tracking, efficient replenishment, and minimal stockouts.</p>
            <h3>1. Inventory Tracking</h3>
            <p>All products must be logged into the inventory management system immediately upon receipt. The following
                details should be recorded:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Category</li>
                <li>Sub-Category</li>
                <li>Product Information</li>
                <li>Quantity</li>
                <li>Cost per Unit</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Stock Replenishment</h3>
            <p>Stock levels should be monitored weekly. If stock levels drop below the minimum threshold, an automatic
                reorder should be triggered.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimum Threshold: 20 units</li>
                <li>Reorder Quantity: Based on average monthly sales</li>
                <li>Supplier Lead Time: 7 days</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Product Returns</h3>
            <p>Returned products must be inspected upon receipt. If they are in resalable condition, they should be
                logged back into inventory. Damaged goods should be recorded and disposed of according to the disposal
                policy.</p>

            <h3>4. Regular Audits</h3>
            <p>Monthly inventory audits are required to ensure the accuracy of the inventory records. Discrepancies
                should be investigated and resolved promptly.</p>
