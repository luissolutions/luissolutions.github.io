With multiple options for data rate, connectivity and trunking options, trying to configure a data center's physical layer mapping 'on the fly' can rapidly turn into a self-defeating exercise. By following a few simple rules, much of the guesswork can be eliminated, while maintaining flexibility and the ability to migrate a small or large portion of your data center as your demand and your budget dictate, but no matter what, you have to have a plan.",

            "Introduction": "Lower operations costs, greater reliability and flexibility in service offerings, quicker deployment of new and upgraded services - these are the characteristics of a successful data center. Wherever you are installing a fiber network, be it a data center, a central office, a mobile switching center, or entrance facility a great deal of fiber optic cabling will be used - the medium which meets both their bandwidth and cost requirements. But just deploying the fiber is not enough; a successful fiber network also requires a well built infrastructure based on a strong fiber cable management system. Management of the fiber cables has a direct impact on network reliability, performance, and cost. It also affects network maintenance and operations, as well as the ability to reconfigure and expand the network, restore service, and implement new services quickly. A strong fiber cable management system provides bend radius protection, cable routing paths, cable accessibility and physical protection of the fiber network. If these concepts are executed correctly, the network can deliver its full competitive advantages."

        "Elements": {
            "BendRadiusProtection": {
                "Description": "Cable raceways, fiber termination panels and distribution frames should be designed, installed and maintained so as to properly manage the minimum allowable bend radius for fiber cables and patch cords.",

                    "Microbends": "Very small bends or deformities in the fiber.",
                    "Macrobends": "Larger bends."
                },
                "Importance": "Fibers bent beyond the specified minimum bend diameters can break, causing service failures and increasing network operations costs. Cable manufacturers, service providers, and others specify a minimum bend radius for fibers and fiber cables. The minimum bend radius will vary depending on the specific fiber cable. However, in general, the minimum bend radius should not be less than ten times the outer diameter (OD) of the fiber cable. Thus a 3 mm cable should not have any bends less than 30mm in radius. This radius is for a fiber cable that is not under any load or tension. If a tensile load is applied to the cable, as in the weight of a cable in a long vertical run or a cable that is pulled tightly between two points, the minimum bend radius is increased, due to the added stress."

            "CableRoutingPaths": {
                "Description": "Cable raceway should be designed, installed and maintained so as to provide easy and intuitive cable routing and proper slack storage.",
                "Importance": "Improper routing of fibers by technicians is one of the major causes of bend radius violations. Routing paths should be clearly defined and easy to follow so that the technician has no other option than to route the cables properly. Well-defined routing paths, on the other hand, reduce the training time required for technicians and increase the uniformity of the work done. The routing paths also ensure that bend radius requirements are maintained at all points, improving network reliability. Additionally, having defined routing paths makes accessing and tracing individual fibers easier, quicker and safer, reducing the time required for reconfigurations. This has a direct effect on network operating costs and the time required to turn-up or restore service. Alternatively, leaving cable routing to the technician's imagination leads to an inconsistently routed, difficult-to-manage fiber network. Improper cable routing also causes increased congestion in the termination panel and the cableways, increasing the possibility of bend radius violations and long-term failure."

                "Description": "Cable management raceways should be designed, installed and maintained so as to provide easy cable and connector access.",
                "Importance": "Allowing easy access to installed fibers is critical in maintaining proper bend radius protection. This accessibility should ensure that any fiber can be installed or removed without inducing a macrobend on an adjacent fiber. The accessibility of the fibers in the fiber cable management system can mean the difference between a network reconfiguration time of 20 minutes per fiber and one of over 90 minutes per fiber. Accessibility is most critical during network reconfiguration operations and directly impacts operation costs and network reliability."

                "Importance": "Fibers routed between pieces of equipment without proper protection are susceptible to damage, which can critically affect network reliability. The fiber cable management system should therefore ensure that every fiber is protected from physical damage along the entire route."

            "CableCongestion": {
                "Description": "Cable congestion is just like traffic congestion. Put too many cars at one time onto a small road and you have traffic problems. It becomes difficult to move from one point to another, and the probability of having an accident increases. The same basic rules apply to fiber congestion in a raceway system. If too many fibers are routed into a single trough, accessing an individual fiber becomes very difficult, and the probability of damaging a fiber increases. This can lead to decreased network reliability and an increase in the time it takes to reconfigure the network."

Whenever possible, FiberGuide support kits should be attached to existing hardware (cable racks, digital cableways, existing threaded rods, or equipment racks). The straight sections on the 4x12 and 4x24 FiberGuide system are exceptionally strong, making frequent placement of supports beneath them unnecessary. Whenever possible, the supports should be placed under the fittings using the mountings. This placement provides the strongest system and requires the least amount of support hardware. If it is not possible to attach the support bracket to the mountings on the fittings, a variable fitting support locator can be installed on the bottom of the fitting, allowing the support to be attached anywhere along the fitting bottom. When combining several straight sections, it is recommended that support brackets are installed on both sides of each junction."

            "description": "Determining fiber drop placement in relation to the fiber connection frames or racks and equipment bays or cabinets is the most critical step in designing a FiberGuide system. Placement of the fiber drop at the fiber distribution frame will vary according to whether the frame is set-up for interconnect or cross-connect configuration. In a similar fashion, the drop location over the fiber optic terminal equipment will vary depending on the particular equipment configuration. Understanding how patch cords are routed on any fiber-fed frame or cabinet is crucial in determining where the fiber exit is placed. A variety of FiberGuide exit options and attachments maximizes the flexibility to design the correct fiber exit to meet the applications. Once the location for the drop has been established, the specifics of which drop to use and how to secure it into position can be determined. These downspouts manage the large fiber drops and route the patch cords correctly for entry into the storage bays. FiberGuide has a full range of fittings to change direction, plane, level, and angle as required."
        },
        "Attachment Points Will Determine Mounting Brackets": {
            "description": "Attachment points for FiberGuide components include ladder racking, ceiling support, auxiliary racking, bay top support, threaded rod, and Unistrut. A variety of mounting hardware provides the flexibility to mount FiberGuide wherever needed. Avoid using Unistrut for 12 inch and 24 inch FiberGuide, as it may not support the weight of high patch cord densities. Also, cantilever brackets should not be supported from Unistrut. When combining several 12 or 24-inch straight sections, install support brackets on each side of the junctions and maintain a maximum distance of five feet between support brackets. If overhead racking is the chosen attachment point, positioning the frame correctly in relation to auxiliary supports or ladder racking is critical to optimal placement for fiber drops. Downspouts are ideal for distribution cabinets where spine fabric switches are located, and Express Exits are ideal for lower density locations such as server cabinets."
        },
        "Capacity & Sizing": {
            "description": "One of the major criteria in a design of a raceway system is the trough capacity for patch cords or cables of different sizes. The total number of patch cords in the system must be calculated to determine which size FiberGuide system is required. The number of cables that the FiberGuide system can handle depends on the patch cord jacket size. FiberGuide is intended to be used with patch cords and not with trunk cables, as minimum bend radius could be violated. The system is designed to ensure a cable always has a 2 inch minimum bend radius, so any cable larger than 0.2 inch or 5mm outside diameter should not be used in the system."
        },
        "Design": {
            "description": "The goal of a FiberGuide system design is effective patch cord routing between the optical distribution frame or fiber termination point and the fiber optic terminal equipment. The FiberGuide system design should accommodate both current and future patch cord capacity requirements. It is important to size the FiberGuide sections that feed core switches and routers, and branch sections that feed server cabinets properly to accommodate both current and future patch cord requirements."

        "Plan, Plan, Plan": {
            "description": "Planning is key when it comes to initial installation of fiber raceways. It's important to consider having the right capacity well into the future, and also from the standpoint of routing within the raceway. There should be diverse pathways to minimize choke points or pile-up points that prevent all the fibers going through the exact same piece of duct or raceway. A fiber frame line-up is more efficient when fed fiber from both ends of the line-up as opposed to all the fiber coming from just one end. Assessing your current fiber counts and planning for future fiber growth is a major step in creating your future-proofed network infrastructure."

    "Project Safety": {
        "Safety Overview": "In this part of the lesson we focus on safety, which is the number one priority in any job. It is always more important than saving time and money but despite its vital importance, safety is often overlooked by those who are responsible for it, both management and employees.",
        "Common Excuses and Consequences": "The most common excuse for ignoring safety is that it gets the job done more quickly at less cost but as we know that is not often true. In fact, not sticking to safety standards can cost a fortune in compensation claims and billions of dollars are paid out every year to workers injured in accidents. Please note: Material offered in this course is meant as a refresher ONLY, and does not meet any official requirement for safety training.",
        "Organizational Responsibility": "It is the responsibility of every organization to train its employees how to work safely, and having trained people in the right procedures, it must ensure those procedures are followed.",
        "Employee Responsibility": "But safety is not just the responsibility of employers. Every worker is expected to work in a professional manner and take some responsibility for their own safety. This means the employee must be aware of the company's safety policies and practices and follow them at all times. A safe work environment is much more likely when each employee makes sure that workplace safety is a major part of their job so you shouldn't depend on others to ensure job safety. It is no comfort when for instance you have received an electric shock to know that someone else said they would turn off the power. It's your body and your life, so make it your responsibility for your safety!",
        "Safety Organizations and Laws": "Let's start by looking at the organizations and laws that promote safety at work - and the regulations and guidelines they provide. The most important safety organization in the US is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, otherwise known as OSHA. The most important safety laws are those introduced under the Occupational Safety and Health Act and back in 1970 Congress passed this act which aims to ensure that every working man and woman in the United States will have a safe and healthy workplace. Under this statute the OSHA was established within the US Department of Labor and is set out in the Code of Federal Regulations. While OSHA is responsible for the administration of the regulations, nearly 50 percent of the states assumed the fieldwork. OSHA is responsible for job site inspections and has the power to levy fines or shutdown an unsafe workplace so its regulations must be taken very seriously.",
        "Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)": "In addition to OSHA regulations, a key part of safety at work is the Material Safety Data Sheet - MSDS. These are provided by the manufacturer for products used in a commercial environment. They provide vital information and are one of the most important documents you should use to ensure safe working with potentially dangerous materials. An MSDS is required for any material that: Can be absorbed through the skin; Inhaled; Ingested; Require special handling for disposal. If you are working with these types of material, be sure you have read the MSDS. These must must be readily available at the job site and either kept in a 3-ring binder, indexed and in alphabetical order by product name, or made available via the internet. Check with your local enforcement office as to which method is approved for your area.",
        "Construction Safety": "Construction of underground facilities requires a substantial amount of manpower, tools and equipment. Underground and aerial construction will expose the manpower, tools and equipment to hazards, dependent upon field conditions and circumstances. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) defines a qualified employee as 'any worker who by reason of training and experience has demonstrated his ability to safely perform his duties'. Only a qualified employee should be assigned duties that could cause harm or potential harm to the construction crew, general public, cable plant and other utilities. This course cannot identify the many hazards that exist in the construction environment, nor can it dictate the caution required with all tools, equipment and field conditions. Three sets of national codes and standards apply to the construction of underground facilities. The OSHA Safety and Health Standards apply to work in telecommunications and utility installations. The National Electrical Code (NEC) applies to inside plant construction. The NEC applies specifically, but is not limited to, plant that is within or on public and private buildings or other structures. The National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) generally applies to outside plant construction. Municipal, state, county and local codes are often applied to the construction of telecommunication and utility systems or work that involves their respective properties and rights-of-way. Pole Lease Agreements often stipulate specific practices related to safety. These codes, regulations and specified practices should be investigated, interpreted, communicated and observed. Countries outside of North America will all have codes, regulations and guidelines that cover safety. For example, the European CENELEC standard EN50174-3 Installation planning and practices outside buildings. Make sure you are aware of these before starting work and comply fully with them during installation.",
        "First Aid and CPR": "Now let's look as some of the things that contribute to a safe working environment. They include both means to avoid accidents and ways to help people who have been in an accident. Let's start with First Aid and CPR. To ensure that help is available on site if there is a problem, every telecommunications installer and supervisor should be certified in first aid and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation - CPR. CPR is an emergency procedure used for a person who is not breathing or whose heart has stopped. Approved training courses are only available through the local chapter of the American Red Cross and/or American Heart Association. Certification through one of these bodies should be renewed annually. By definition, First Aid is emergency treatment given before professional medical help arrives. Training will help you to act properly and give aid in the event of an emergency. If the worst happens these skills can be a life saver, but first aid requires the right materials. The supervisor or project manager should make certain that the required first aid kit is available on the job site and the required are included. When checking first aid kits used on the job site, also make sure that the contents are replaced in a timely manner and many first aid supplies are time-dated, so may not be effective after the expiry date.",
        "Eye Washing": "Eye washing can save someone's eyesight in the case of an accident with chemicals or sharp debris. In cases where sites do not have fresh water freely available - or eyewash fountains are installed throughout - it is important that a portable eyewash station is set up somewhere easily accessible.",
        "Emergency Rescue Steps": "When an emergency happens, the installer may not have the time to ask questions or get out the book. In many cases you only have one chance to make the correct decision to save a life. There are many reported instances where an untrained, but good intentioned individual, also became a victim in the emergency. In many cases, training in first aid, CPR and emergency rescue are combined into one comprehensive training program. There are six basic steps to safely assist others in an emergency rescue without endangering yourself. These are: 1. Survey the scene - check for fire, toxic fumes, live electrical wires, heavy vehicle traffic, or anything else which may have caused the injury. 2. Notify someone - let someone else know that there is an emergency and you require assistance. 3. Secure the area - to make it safe for both you and the victim. When required, turn off electrical circuits, gas, and if necessary, the water. 4. Perform a preliminary survey of the victim - remember your ABC's. 'A' is for airways - be sure the victim's airway is clear. 'B' is for breathing - check this, and 'C' is for circulation or pulse - also check for this. 5. Call emergency medical services (EMS). Request someone call EMS and give them all the information you have collected to this point. 6. Perform a secondary survey of the victim. Check for secondary or non-life threatening injuries such as cuts, abrasions, or broken bones.",
        "Work Area Safety": "A first step in making sure emergencies don't happen to you is to use safety cones and caution tape to cordon off the area where you will be working. Be certain to notify any personnel near the work area that you will be working there, and what you will be doing. Do not cordon off the area any longer than necessary or leave the work area unattended and when working near doorways or hallway corners, be certain that the oncoming pedestrian traffic can tell that there is a work area ahead.",
        "Tool Safety": "Many work injuries are cause by misuse of tools. You can avoid this by following some simple rules: Use tools only for their intended purpose; Only use tools on which you have been trained or certified; Follow manufacturer's instructions for the use of these tools; Examine both hand and power tools to ensure that they are in proper working order and that all guards are in place. Broken tools must be immediately taken out of service and tagged as broken or defective.",
        "Power Tool Safety": "The rules that apply to hand tools are even more important for power tools. If you are unsure as to the proper use of a tool, don't be afraid to ask questions or get out the book and study. With electrical tools, be sure they are grounded and use extension cords equipped with GFI protectors. Where safety guards should be fitted to a tool, make sure these are in place. Never remove or displace a guard to 'make the job easier'. Avoid blind drilling and sawing. There may be a power line, gas pipe or vital support behind the surface you are cutting through.",
        "Power Nailer Safety": "Power nailers can be lethal weapons and the amount of energy they release can shatter materials and cause serious harm if misused. Nailers powered by powder cartridges require users to be licensed and should never be used by untrained workers. When using a power nailer, check the area behind the surface you are nailing into is clear, in case nails go right through the materials you are nailing. And always ensure you have the right nailer, nails and cartridge for the material you are nailing. Do not attempt to drive nails or other fasteners into: Brittle or very hard material. This includes such materials as glazed tile, glass blocks, face brick, or old concrete as the shattering of these materials can cause a safety hazard for both the worker and anyone in the area; Soft or easily penetrated material. In this case, the nail or other fasteners may pass straight through.",
        "Electrical Safety": "As telecommunications installers, we become very complacent when working around new construction. One of the problems with new construction is that in many cases we have open electrical panels. Remember, all electrical systems are potential KILLERS, and ALL personnel should be aware of their dangers. Most fatal electric shocks do not happen to the uninitiated - they happen to people who should know better. Getting sloppy or over confident is a big mistake. It's a popular misconception that high voltage is the big killer. In fact, it's CURRENT, not voltage that is an installer's enemy. The effects of current are: 2-3 milliamps: Produces a tingling of the skin; 10 milliamps: Produces a painful shock; 100-200 milliamps: Ventricular fibrillation occurs, damaging the heart, ending in probable death; Above 200 milliamps the heart clamps tight, severe burns occur. When coming in contact with electrical circuits, consider them all as live - or HOT - until proven otherwise. Never intentionally expose yourself to an electrical shock - it is not a sensible way to test whether a circuit is live. Always use an approved testing device to determine the status of the circuit. You also need to attend electrical safety training to understand and avoid the risks of working with electricity. And, before working with electrical circuits remove jewelry, but don't put it in your pockets as this only moves the conductor from one part of your body to another. Also be sure to wear rubber-soled shoes as these may help to insulate you and reduce the current flowing in your body if you accidentally become part of an electrical circuit. To protect your head from contact with live wires as well as hard objects, wear an approved hard hat. This is especially important when working above a false ceiling. Another sensible and obvious precaution against shocks is to avoid working on energized equipment. Unless you are a licensed electrician, turn that part of the project over to the personnel who are trained to do the job. To ensure circuits are not live, lock and tag the breaker. If you cannot avoid working on or near live equipment, make sure you have a qualified safety observer nearby. Another foundation for safety is good communications. Radio can play a part in this, especially in coordinating the lockout tag out procedures. But always be sure to verify all transmissions. Several trades may be using radios sharing your frequency, which could become very confusing and possibly life threatening. A confirmation that power is 'off' may come from someone else working on a different circuit in another part of the site.",
        "Ladder Safety": "Simple things - and well as sophisticated things like radio communications - are also factors in safety. Misuse of the simple ladder is a notorious cause of accidents. More than half of these accidents are in construction trades. Telecommunications personnel, like everyone else, are required to follow OSHA regulations when working aloft. Here are some examples of how not to work at high level. Using whatever is to be had to gain some height may save a minute, but breaking a bone will waste months. Here are six rules for ladder safety: 1. Designate the work area with cones and tape; 2. Use NON-conductive ladders for electrical work; 3. Inspect ladders prior to use - look out for defects and weaknesses; 4. Do not paint ladders - paint hides cracks and defects; 5. Always face the ladder when climbing; 6. You're liable, so never lend or borrow ladders. Here are some other commonsense don'ts in the use of ladders: Never throw anything up or intentionally drop anything from a ladder. Never exceed the ladders rated weight limit. This is easy to do as we forget to add the weight of the materials you carry to your own weight to get the total weight on the ladder. And ensure the area around the ladder is clear, stepping down or falling onto clutter may cause a fall or make the effects of a fall worse.",
        "Step Ladder Safety": "When working from a step ladder open the legs completely and lock the side rails. Only use them on solid level surfaces. Never stand on the top two steps or reach out too far beyond the side rails. Remember the belt buckle rule: So long as your belt buckle remains within the confines of the ladder, you will be able to retain your balance, and never leave tools or materials on steps or rungs. Be sure and check the area in which you will be working to identify any unsafe conditions around the ladder which might cause an injury during a fall.",
        "Extension Ladder Safety": "When using an extension ladder, place the base of the ladder so that it extends out away from the wall 25 percent of the ladder's height. For example, a 20 foot ladder would have the base placed a minimum of 5 foot from the wall. Overlap at least three full sets of rungs at the ladder's midpoint. Also when placing an extension ladder: Be sure you always use ladders with non-slip feet; Support both side rails at the top, or use a single point supporting attachment; Secure the base, lash if necessary; Make sure the top of the ladder extends up to the work and 36 inches above cat walks, lofts, or roof lines; Raise and lower tools and materials with a rope and canvas bag, commonly referred to as a 'grunt sack' utilizing an assistant.",
        "Lifting Safety": "Thousands of injuries are caused each year and millions or man hours are lost through back injuries. Usually these are the result of bad lifting and carrying techniques - or simply trying to lift too much. The 'old ailing back' is one of our most common complaints. To help avoid serious back injury: Lift smoothly without jerky motions; Lift with your legs and not your back; Lift up to 50lbs and carry up to 25lbs; Know your route and do not block your vision. Get assistance with heavy or awkward loads and when carrying them, turn by moving your feet. This avoids twisting your back while it is under stress.",
        "Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)": "On the job site, our best friend is our personal protective equipment. Personal protective equipment is safety equipment worn by a worker. When used correctly, personal protective equipment greatly decreases the telecommunications worker's risk of injury. When it is used incorrectly - or not used - it can leave the worker exposed to a wide variety of dangers. Personal protective equipment must fit well and be as comfortable as possible. Equipment that fits properly and comfortably ensures that the cable installer and the protective equipment can work at the same time. It is important to inspect personal protective equipment each time it is used. Look for wear, cracks, tears, punctures, weak joints, or other signs that the equipment may not be able to provide protection. Report any problems to the proper supervisor. Never use defective protective equipment. Remember that no amount of protective equipment can provide complete protection. Often the best personal protection comes from using caution, proper procedures, and common sense when working. The personal protective equipment that a cable installer is required to wear when performing a task depends on: The hazards of task; The hazards at the work site; Local, state, and national safety requirements.",
        "Hard Hat": "Personal protective equipment includes but is not limited to the following: Hard hat - generally, the hard hats for telecommunications workers afford both physical and electrical protection. Cable installers should ensure that their hard hats provide electrical protection before working around power lines or equipment. The hard hat must fit securely enough to ensure that it will not slip and block the cable installer's vision or fall onto the equipment is working on. Cable installers may choose to use a chin strap to secure the hard hat only if the chin strap is thin enough to give way easily if the hard hat catches on something during a fall.",
        "Eye Protection": "Eye protection - Cable installers must wear eye protection (full-face shield, goggles or glasses) whenever there is a potential hazard to the eyes. A wide variety of work situations require eye protection, including: Working with batteries; Using power fastening tools; Working with copper cable; Working with optical fibers; Any situation in which the cable installer is working above eye level and looking up at the work.",
        "Respirators and Masks": "Respirators and masks: Cable installers must wear a respirator or filter mask whenever a harmful dust, gas, smoke, chemical vapor, or other pollutant is present at the work site. When selecting a respirator, be certain that it is designed to protect you from the chemical vapors which may be in the area where you will be working. For example, a respirator designed to protect you from chlorine vapor is not suitable for an area which contains ammonia vapor. Should you encounter another worker on the job site wearing a respirator, remember that if the atmosphere is dangerous enough for them to be wearing a respirator, you should either be wearing a proper respirator or vacate the area. Never work without the proper breathing protection. The effects of breathing some harmful substances may not show up until hours, weeks, or years after exposure. Filter masks are used in cases where the atmosphere is moderately hazardous. Very hazardous atmospheres require the use of gas masks or even compressed air respirators. To provide the proper protection, each mask must seal itself to the user's face. This may require the removal of facial hair. Several chemical manufacturing plants will not allow personnel with any facial hair to work onsite prior to shaving. Cable installers should not try to work wearing a breathing protection device unless: They have been fully trained in how to use the device; The device has been properly fitted; They have been found physically fit to work while wearing the device.",
        "Lifting Belts": "Lifting belts: Lifting belts do not give the user any added strength. The belt is designed to be worn around the abdomen and help support the stomach muscles while encouraging proper posture. Use correct lifting techniques when lifting any object (i.e., lifting with the legs and not with the back, turn with your feet and not at the waist).",
        "Protective Footwear": "Protective footwear: Protective footwear (steel-toed safety shoes) are designed to protect the wearer on work sites where feet could be injured by falling objects, rolling carts or by stepping on sharp objects. A good set of shoes will protect your feet from injury and fatigue. An alternative is the electrical hazard safety shoes which are designed to protect the wearer from open electrical circuits of 600 volts or less under dry conditions. These shoes are secondary protection on surfaces that are substantially insulated. These shoes meet ANSI Z41 PT 99 Section 4 requirements. Caution: These shoes should not be worn in explosive or hazardous areas where conductive footwear is required.",
        "Detection Badges and Exposure Monitors": "Detection badges and exposure monitors: Some work sites may require workers to wear a detection badge or use a monitor to ensure that exposure to a hazardous substance does not exceed safe levels. Understand how the badge or monitor works before entering the hazardous area.",
        "Gloves": "Leather and rubber gloves: Wear physically protective gloves when performing any work that has the potential for hand injuries. Leather gloves provide protection from cuts, abrasions and extreme temperatures. Rubber gloves provide protection from harmful chemicals.",
        "Hearing Protectors": "Hearing protectors: Wear hearing protection whenever you have to work in the vicinity of loud noises. Even the sound of a hammer striking a metal clamp onto the red iron requires hearing protection. If you experience a ringing in your ears, you do not have adequate hearing protection. There are three different type of hearing protective devices. They are: Disposable, foam plugs that you roll between your fingers and slip into your ear canal. When you are finished with them, they are discarded. Re-usable rubber earplugs. These may be on a breakaway cord or individually housed in a pocket-sized plastic container. The breakaway ones are convenient, they may be attached to your hard hat or around your neck and tucked inside your shirt. It is vital that they be on a breakaway cord to prevent strangling. Aural, are the types resembling ear muffs. These are available in passive or active. The active ones are popular with shooting enthusiasts. Normal conversation can be heard until a loud noise occurs, than the protection automatically dampens the louder sound.",
        "Full Body Harness": "A full body harness with two lanyards is required when working from man lifts and buckets. Non-compliance may result in both the owner and installer being fined. Clothing should be reasonably snug, but must allow for freedom of movement. Do not wear dangling or floppy clothing that may get caught on tools or surroundings. Keep shirt tails tucked in, cuffs (if any) buttoned or neatly rolled up, etc. This is especially important when the cable installer is working in a confined space, on an elevating device, or near operating machinery. Do not wear metal jewelry when working on telecommunications circuits or equipment.",
        "Lighting": "One of the major challenges we face when working in the telecommunications room is ensuring adequate lighting. Proper lighting will help prevent accidents and rework. Ensure you have enough light to safely and efficiently complete your work so use portable lighting when necessary.",
        "Confined Space": "There are three main criteria for a confined space. It has to be large enough to work in, it may have limited or restricted entry or exit and it is not designed to be lived in.",
        "Types of Confined Spaces": "Types of confined spaces include those with open tops or those with depth that can or will restrict the normal movement of air. They may be trenches or ditches etc. or areas with limited or restricted openings for entrance and exit. These might include battery rooms, underground vaults, or maintenance holes, etc Classifications of confined spaces include Non-permitted Confined Space and Permit-Required Confined Space. The latter meets all the criteria of a confined space but additional criteria make it Permit-Required Confined Space. It contains or has the potential to contain a hazardous atmosphere and/or it contains a material that has the potential for engulfing an entrant, or it has the internal configuration such that an entrant could be trapped or asphyxiated by inwardly converging walls or by a floor which is sloped downward and tapers to a smaller cross-section, or it contains any other recognized safety or health hazard.",
        "Permit-Required Confined Space Program": "A Permit-Required Confined Space Program is required by OSHA to be written and implemented prior to any employee entering a Permit-Required Confined Space. This contains: What measures are to be taken to ensure security against unauthorized entry; Identify and evaluate what hazards are possible within the Permit-Required Confined Space; Develop procedures and practices for safe Permit-Required Confined Spaces: Specifying the acceptable entry conditions, Isolating the permit space, Purging, inerting, flushing or ventilating the space as necessary to eliminate or control atmospheric hazards, Providing pedestrian, vehicle and other barriers as are necessary to protect the entrants from external hazards. Permit-Required Confined Space Training Requirements must be completed before any employee enters the space, or whenever there is a change in the operations of the Permit-Required Confined Space, or whenever there is any doubt about the employee's knowledge and abilities. For Entrants, training must include: Knowledge of the hazards which may be encountered, including the signs, symptoms and consequences of exposure; Know the proper use of the equipment for the space; Know and be able to demonstrate proper communications procedures with the attendant, including: Signs or symptoms of over-exposure, Detection of a prohibited condition, Exit from the space as quickly as possible when the attendant or the entry supervisor orders evacuation. For Attendants, training must include: Monitoring the entrant status and determines if it is safe to continue the work in the space; Monitoring the entrant's behavioral patterns for possible exposure; Orders the evacuation of the space if: A situation arises outside the space which would endanger the entrant; If the attendant cannot effectively and safely perform their tasks. Other countries will vary in terms of the documentation and procedures required for confined space entry - ensure it is followed.",
        "Permit-Required Confined Space Required Equipment": "Permit-Required Confined Space Required Equipment includes: Testing and monitoring equipment for pre-entry and periodic air sampling of the space; Ventilating equipment; Communications equipment; Any personal protective equipment that is beyond the scope of routine normal usage.",
        "Additional Required Equipment": "Permit-Required Confined Space Required Equipment also includes: Lighting equipment; Barriers and shields; Ingress and egress equipment such as ladders; Rescue and emergency equipment as required, unless it is provided by rescue services; Any other equipment which may be necessary for safe entry and rescue from the Permit-Required Confined Space.",
        "Full Body Harness for Rescue": "In addition, full body harnesses are required for rescue purposes.",
        "National One-Call System": "The National One-Call System, which is a legal statute in most North American states, mandates call-before-you-dig, and requires specific information for a location, and restricts digging to after a specific time. The system delays digging from 48 to 72 hours from time of request, and can vary from state to state. Some states mandate minimum and maximum time limits of calling for locates prior to digging. The general information required for a locate include: County, city, or township; Location of work - street address; Intersecting streets/roads; Distance from intersection/direction; Extent of work front/rear/both sides; Date of excavation; Start time of excavation; Type of work; Caller's name; Contractor/contact number; Contact person/additional information. The process is that the contractor call One-Call System, and then wait the prescribed period before digging. You may need to renew your locate number prior to the expiration if the job will extend beyond the 10 working day period. Failure to renew locate numbers prior to expiration will require that you establish new locate numbers and a new waiting period to digging. The American Public Works Association has assigned colors for each utility that is to be marked as located. Other countries may also implement similar access restrictions. Remember, 'Communications' is ORANGE... and call, before you dig!!!"

    "Fiber Optic Safety": {
        "Introduction": "Welcome to Lesson 7.4 Fiber Optic Safety. Safety is the top priority in any activity and handling optical fiber cable is no exception. All the normal work and site safety considerations apply and there are some additional risks that demand special care. In this lesson we explore some of the important considerations.",
        "Fiber Safety Categories": "We can divide fiber safety considerations into five categories: 1. Dangers from laser and (to a lesser extent) LED light sources; 2. Risk of injury from cables, components and tools; 3. Risk of injury by large cable reels; 4. Danger of poisoning or injury by chemicals; 5. General risks in the work site environment.",
        "Laser Safety": "Most of the laser wavelengths used in most Enterprise, TELCO and CATV applications are out of the visible spectrum, so you don't realize when they are pointing into your eyes. In addition, lasers emitting in at 850 nm and 1300 nm wavelength (which are outside the visible spectrum) can cause damage to the retina without causing any pain. Employees working with lasers can be exposed to direct or reflected light greater than 0.005 watts (5 milliwatts).",
        "Laser Damage": "Laser emitters amplify and concentrate light energy. The damage lasers can do to eyes and skin is similar to prolonged exposure to direct sunlight - only it can happen in a second. Because laser light travels in a parallel beam, the lens in the eye focuses its energy on a very small area of the retina at the back of the eye. The retina consists of light sensitive nerve endings that very are quickly destroyed by this concentrated energy. Laser light, like normal light, can cover a wide spectrum of wavelengths from ultraviolet to infrared.",
        "Laser Standards": "Lasers standards are covered by the ANSI Z136.1 and discuss all aspects of the classes and even the legal requirements for working with them. Lasers are classified for safety purposes, Classes 1 to 4, with a few sub-categories, and this is based on their power output and potential for causing injury to either eyes and/or skin. All laser products are required by law to have a classification label.",
        "Class 1M Lasers": "Class 1M: This type of laser will be found in basic multimode transmission which you will be familiar with as a sparkling red light. The M stands for Magnifying Option Caution, so is a warning that even at this low power, looking at a fiber connector end-face through a microscope could cause eye damage.",
        "Class 2 Lasers": "Class 2 or even 3R includes items such as a wireless presenter used by a lecturer or teacher. These are relatively safe for eye exposure, but even lasers at this low intensity are an eye irritant and should not be pointed directly into anyone's eyes. In our industry another Class 2 rated product that we would use on a regular basis is a VFL (Visual Fault Locator) used for tracing fibers from fiber panel to panel.",
        "Class 3 Lasers": "Class 3 is divided into two sub-classes, 3R and 3B. Class 3R (which stands for Reduced Requirements) have reduced product safety requirements and represent a transitional zone between safe and hazardous laser products. A 3B classed device can heat skin and materials but are not considered a burn hazard. In this region you need to be careful as this type of laser may may be hazardous when directly viewed and also its reflection as well.",
        "Class 4 Lasers": "Class 4 lasers are high powered with output that is hazardous to eyes or skin from the direct beam, specular reflections and in some cases even diffuse reflections. Class 4 lasers often have sufficient optical power to be a fire hazard as well so must be equipped with a key switch and have a safety interlock. Other applications that could use this class of laser are CWDM and DWDM equipment.",
        "Field Safety": "When called out to attend to a fiber optic cable break, basic safety precautions must be observed. If the cable has been definitely broken, dug up or cut in half, all powered optical equipment connected to that fiber cable must be de-energized or switched off. Your personal safety takes priority and secondly your ability to repair that fiber can only be done when all power to that fiber is removed.",
        "Fiber Link Issues": "The second type of call-out may be to a fiber link that has stopped working for no identifiable reason or where the customer has been using half the fibers in the cable to date and has just connected up some of the remaining pairs and has problems. Number one priority is to switch off the active equipment at each end before doing any testing. You basically then have two routes to follow: 1) Identify the polarity is correct, transmit goes to receive etc and this could also involve using a VFL to check this circuitry; 2) Look at the fiber connector end-faces to ensure there is no contamination, dust, dirt or fingermarks.",
        "Eye Safety": "To avoid eye damage from lasers, these are some key safety steps. Ensure the equipment you are working on is deactivated (switched off). Treat it as electricity and do not work on (repair or terminate) live systems. When working with a colleague ensure that both of you are finished working before re-activating the equipment. Tape up the switches and leave notices on the active equipment that they are being worked on and should not be switched on.",
        "Fiber Cables and Chemicals": "As well as carrying potentially damaging laser light, fiber cables themselves - and the work that is done on them - have potential risks. Chemicals used in preparing fibers for splicing can directly damage tissue and fuel a fire. Isopropyl alcohol is inflammable and could be explosive under some conditions. There are now non-flammable fiber prep fluids available on the market.",
        "Tool Safety": "Here are a few simple rules when working with sharp tools and materials. First, wear protective gloves whenever possible and use eye protection at all times. When using cutting tools, always make the cut away from you. It's an obvious point and one that you've probably been hearing since you first got to hold a knife. But tens of thousands of people every year forget this - and have the scars to prove it.",
        "Reel Handling": "Here are some of the specific dos and dont's of heavy reel handling: DO NOT drop reels off the back of the truck onto a stack of tires, onto ground or any other surface; DO use a pallet jack or forklift to remove all cables on pallets; DO use a ramp if trailer and dock are not at the same height; DO use ramps that are strong enough to support the reel weight and long enough to control the cable as it is rolled off the truck.",
        "Chemical Safety": "Here are some things you should remember when working with chemicals. Those you will encounter when working with optical fiber cleaning agents and adhesives include diethylene triamide and methacrylic ester. These are complex substances that can have complex effects on the human body. So: Do not absorb them via your lungs, skin or digestive system; Do use them in well ventilated areas away from food and drink; Do wear protective gloves where possible when handling them; Do not eat or drink where they are being used; Do not get them in contact with skin, eyes or clothes; Do not get B-Sealant in contact with your eyes, it causes irritation; Do not let isopropyl alcohol or acetone near sources of intense heat (including laser light).",
        "Work Area Safety": "A clean, uncluttered, well designed work area is important to safe working. Misplaced tools and materials are the cause of many accidents. So make sure your work area is tidy and has space to layout the tools and materials you need in a neat and convenient way. Always have your safety equipment, such as glasses, with you and your eye wash kit to hand. Also never eat or drink in the work area. Ingested fiber can cause serious problems.",
        "Site Safety Requirements": "Finally, you must remember that, when laying cable on a site, you are subject to all the same safety and safety equipment requirements as other contractors. Make sure you know the site rules and follow them. Hard hats, toe-protector boots and visibility jackets will be needed on construction sites as well as safety glasses. In North America, companies are subject to U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations. In other countries, we are subject to their equivalent sets of laws. In almost all cases those laws allocate liability to the managers and supervisors of employees who are injured through lack of suitable knowledge, training or equipment."

    "Fiber Duplex Polarity": {
        "Introduction": "Most fiber channels use separate transmit and receive paths between the active equipment. On rare occasions, a simplex channel is used. The design of the fiber system must manage the path to prevent mistakes when patching active equipment. There are two reasons for this: safety and ensuring correct functionality.",
        "Reasons for Managing Fiber Polarity": [
