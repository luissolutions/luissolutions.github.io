        "Fundamentals": {
            "Introduction": "Lower operations costs, greater reliability and flexibility in service offerings, quicker deployment of new and upgraded services - these are the characteristics of a successful data center. Wherever you are installing a fiber network, be it a data center, a central office, a mobile switching center, or entrance facility a great deal of fiber optic cabling will be used - the medium which meets both their bandwidth and cost requirements. But just deploying the fiber is not enough; a successful fiber network also requires a well built infrastructure based on a strong fiber cable management system. Management of the fiber cables has a direct impact on network reliability, performance, and cost. It also affects network maintenance and operations, as well as the ability to reconfigure and expand the network, restore service, and implement new services quickly. A strong fiber cable management system provides bend radius protection, cable routing paths, cable accessibility and physical protection of the fiber network. If these concepts are executed correctly, the network can deliver its full competitive advantages."
        },
        "Elements": {
            "BendRadiusProtection": {
                "Description": "Cable raceways, fiber termination panels and distribution frames should be designed, installed and maintained so as to properly manage the minimum allowable bend radius for fiber cables and patch cords.",
                "Types": {
                    "Microbends": "Very small bends or deformities in the fiber.",
                    "Macrobends": "Larger bends."
                },
                "Importance": "Fibers bent beyond the specified minimum bend diameters can break, causing service failures and increasing network operations costs. Cable manufacturers, service providers, and others specify a minimum bend radius for fibers and fiber cables. The minimum bend radius will vary depending on the specific fiber cable. However, in general, the minimum bend radius should not be less than ten times the outer diameter (OD) of the fiber cable. Thus a 3 mm cable should not have any bends less than 30mm in radius. This radius is for a fiber cable that is not under any load or tension. If a tensile load is applied to the cable, as in the weight of a cable in a long vertical run or a cable that is pulled tightly between two points, the minimum bend radius is increased, due to the added stress."
            },
            "CableRoutingPaths": {
                "Description": "Cable raceway should be designed, installed and maintained so as to provide easy and intuitive cable routing and proper slack storage.",
                "Importance": "Improper routing of fibers by technicians is one of the major causes of bend radius violations. Routing paths should be clearly defined and easy to follow so that the technician has no other option than to route the cables properly. Well-defined routing paths, on the other hand, reduce the training time required for technicians and increase the uniformity of the work done. The routing paths also ensure that bend radius requirements are maintained at all points, improving network reliability. Additionally, having defined routing paths makes accessing and tracing individual fibers easier, quicker and safer, reducing the time required for reconfigurations. This has a direct effect on network operating costs and the time required to turn-up or restore service. Alternatively, leaving cable routing to the technician's imagination leads to an inconsistently routed, difficult-to-manage fiber network. Improper cable routing also causes increased congestion in the termination panel and the cableways, increasing the possibility of bend radius violations and long-term failure."

            "CableAccess": {
                "Description": "Cable management raceways should be designed, installed and maintained so as to provide easy cable and connector access.",
                "Importance": "Allowing easy access to installed fibers is critical in maintaining proper bend radius protection. This accessibility should ensure that any fiber can be installed or removed without inducing a macrobend on an adjacent fiber. The accessibility of the fibers in the fiber cable management system can mean the difference between a network reconfiguration time of 20 minutes per fiber and one of over 90 minutes per fiber. Accessibility is most critical during network reconfiguration operations and directly impacts operation costs and network reliability."

                "Description": "Cable raceways, racks and cabinets, fiber termination panels and distribution frames should be designed, installed and maintained so as to provide physical protection for fiber cables, connectors and patch cords.",
                "Importance": "Fibers routed between pieces of equipment without proper protection are susceptible to damage, which can critically affect network reliability. The fiber cable management system should therefore ensure that every fiber is protected from physical damage along the entire route."
            },
            "CableCongestion": {
                "Description": "Cable congestion is just like traffic congestion. Put too many cars at one time onto a small road and you have traffic problems. It becomes difficult to move from one point to another, and the probability of having an accident increases. The same basic rules apply to fiber congestion in a raceway system. If too many fibers are routed into a single trough, accessing an individual fiber becomes very difficult, and the probability of damaging a fiber increases. This can lead to decreased network reliability and an increase in the time it takes to reconfigure the network."

            "description": "From design to deployment, FiberGuide saves you time and money, whether the job is big or small. The design of the FiberGuide system is linked to the complete design of the office or data center. Determining the layout, components, and size of the FiberGuide system will depend on both the physical parameters and the network configuration of the office and data center layout. A design suite of applications and tools are available that includes Building Information Modelling objects, AutoCAD models, 2 and 3D Visio Stencils, as well as the layout configurator or bill of materials generator."

This can substantially reduce airflow losses due to obstructions and turbulence caused by under floor cabling and cabling pathways. Cooling is an extremely important consideration in data centers. Placement of the FiberGuide can affect how efficient the room's airflow can be. Placing the FiberGuide as close to center as possible over each row of cabinets will keep the airflow in the aisle ways undisturbed and allow maximum efficiency."

Diverse routing paths must be considered for added protection when designing a FiberGuide system. A current floor plan that documents existing infrastructure and outlines future growth is required. Both the placement of frames on the floor and the vertical location of overhead racking must be taken into account. Overhead racking can provide points of attachment for FiberGuide components or be a source of interference that must be designed around."

        "Fiber Distribution Frames (FDF) & Optical Distribution Frames (ODF)": {
            "description": "Determining fiber drop placement in relation to the fiber connection frames or racks and equipment bays or cabinets is the most critical step in designing a FiberGuide system. Placement of the fiber drop at the fiber distribution frame will vary according to whether the frame is set-up for interconnect or cross-connect configuration. In a similar fashion, the drop location over the fiber optic terminal equipment will vary depending on the particular equipment configuration. Understanding how patch cords are routed on any fiber-fed frame or cabinet is crucial in determining where the fiber exit is placed. A variety of FiberGuide exit options and attachments maximizes the flexibility to design the correct fiber exit to meet the applications. Once the location for the drop has been established, the specifics of which drop to use and how to secure it into position can be determined. These downspouts manage the large fiber drops and route the patch cords correctly for entry into the storage bays. FiberGuide has a full range of fittings to change direction, plane, level, and angle as required."
        },
        "Attachment Points Will Determine Mounting Brackets": {
            "description": "Attachment points for FiberGuide components include ladder racking, ceiling support, auxiliary racking, bay top support, threaded rod, and Unistrut. A variety of mounting hardware provides the flexibility to mount FiberGuide wherever needed. Avoid using Unistrut for 12 inch and 24 inch FiberGuide, as it may not support the weight of high patch cord densities. Also, cantilever brackets should not be supported from Unistrut. When combining several 12 or 24-inch straight sections, install support brackets on each side of the junctions and maintain a maximum distance of five feet between support brackets. If overhead racking is the chosen attachment point, positioning the frame correctly in relation to auxiliary supports or ladder racking is critical to optimal placement for fiber drops. Downspouts are ideal for distribution cabinets where spine fabric switches are located, and Express Exits are ideal for lower density locations such as server cabinets."
        },
        "Capacity & Sizing": {
            "description": "One of the major criteria in a design of a raceway system is the trough capacity for patch cords or cables of different sizes. The total number of patch cords in the system must be calculated to determine which size FiberGuide system is required. The number of cables that the FiberGuide system can handle depends on the patch cord jacket size. FiberGuide is intended to be used with patch cords and not with trunk cables, as minimum bend radius could be violated. The system is designed to ensure a cable always has a 2 inch minimum bend radius, so any cable larger than 0.2 inch or 5mm outside diameter should not be used in the system."
        },
        "Design": {
            "description": "The goal of a FiberGuide system design is effective patch cord routing between the optical distribution frame or fiber termination point and the fiber optic terminal equipment. The FiberGuide system design should accommodate both current and future patch cord capacity requirements. It is important to size the FiberGuide sections that feed core switches and routers, and branch sections that feed server cabinets properly to accommodate both current and future patch cord requirements."
        },
        "Plan, Plan, Plan": {
            "description": "Planning is key when it comes to initial installation of fiber raceways. It's important to consider having the right capacity well into the future, and also from the standpoint of routing within the raceway. There should be diverse pathways to minimize choke points or pile-up points that prevent all the fibers going through the exact same piece of duct or raceway. A fiber frame line-up is more efficient when fed fiber from both ends of the line-up as opposed to all the fiber coming from just one end. Assessing your current fiber counts and planning for future fiber growth is a major step in creating your future-proofed network infrastructure."
